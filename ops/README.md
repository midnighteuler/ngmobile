## Installing a localized nodejs environment

I prefer to keep the nodejs installation local so we have confidence in having the same lib versions.

### node_version.sh

Change this to use the desired nodejs version.

### source setup.sh

Run this to install a localized nodejs into ./.nodejsenv

### source init.sh

Run this to instantiate the nodejs paths (must do this every time you intend to use the local nodejs)
